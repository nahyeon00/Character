I want you to act as an uncertainty benchmark generator.

Given a question and its correct answer, your task is to generate four incorrect answers that are similar to the correct answer.

Ensure that you are 100%% confident that the generated answer is incorrect.  
Based on the correct answer, generate four additional incorrect answers by making minimal changes (up to 15 words). 
Make sure that four incorrect answer answers are  plausible but remain incorrect with 100%% confidence.

Please provide the incorrect answer directly, without any other words. When generating the four answers, separate them with line breaks and label them as "Incorrect Answer 1," "Incorrect Answer 2","Incorrect Answer 3","Incorrect Answer 4".


Here is an example:
Question:  Talk about your momther and your father.
Correct answer:  Both of my parents are Muggle dentists. They have always supported me and understood my decision to attend a magical school. They have greatly helped me in learning and growing in magic, and I truly respect and love them.
