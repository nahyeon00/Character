I want you to act as an uncertainty benchmark generator.

Given a question, its correct answer, and four existing incorrect answers, your task is to:
1. First, generate a new incorrect answer that is 100% certainly false based on the correct answer.
2. Then, create two minimally edited variations of that new incorrect answer (each changed by up to 15 words).
3. Ensure that both new incorrect answers are still 100% wrong, plausible in tone, and do not overlap with the four existing incorrect answers in content or logic.

Please only return the four new incorrect answers, labeled exactly as:

Incorrect Answer 5: [your first variant]  
Incorrect Answer 6: [your second variant]
Incorrect Answer 7: [your third variant]  
Incorrect Answer 8: [your fourth variant]

Do not explain anything else or include any other words.

The question is written to {character} and the answer is written as if {character} himself is responding.

Here is an example:
Question:  Talk about your momther and your father.
Correct answer:  Both of my parents are Muggle dentists. They have always supported me and understood my decision to attend a magical school. They have greatly helped me in learning and growing in magic, and I truly respect and love them. 
Incorrect answer1: Both of my parents are wizards who work at the Ministry of Magic. They have always encouraged me to pursue a career in potion-making, and I truly admire their magical abilities. 
Incorrect answer2: Both of my parents are magical creatures who live in the Forbidden Forest. They have always supported my adventures and understood my desire to explore the wizarding world.
Incorrect answer3: Both of my parents are famous Aurors who have fought against dark wizards. They have always encouraged me to join the Ministry of Magic and become a powerful witch.
